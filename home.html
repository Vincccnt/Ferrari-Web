            <p>He was born in Modena, but in 1916, his father died of the flu. He built his company by making several supercars, sports cars and racing cars that bore his name and were given the 'Prancing Horse' emblem. 

                The prancing horse emblem was inspired by a painting that adorned the fuselage of a fighter plane flown by Francesco Baracca in World War I. Initially, Ferrari placed the engine at the front of the car, like other cars. However, since 1961, the engines of Ferrari cars have been placed at the back.
